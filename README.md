# Implementation for CFAIL GB paper

This code is based on https://github.com/ASDiscreteMathematics/gb_benchmarks with some changes. 

## Requirements
The code uses [fgb_sage](https://fgb-sage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library. We run the code on `Linux 5.16.13-1.el7.elrepo.x86_64` machine with `Intel(R) Xeon(R) E-2124 CPU @ 3.30GHz` and `512 GB` memory.


## Running the experiments 
The code will execute a specific instance that is described in the abstract file. The parameters of each instance can be found in the related function of `attack.sage`. The code will run tests at the begining of each execution to ensure the soundness of polynomial systems. To disable testing, change line `201` of `attack.sage` to `testing = False`. 

To run the code for rescue: 
```
sage attack.sage rescue
```

To run the code for Posedion, run:
```
sage attack.sage poseidon 0
```
Poseidon has two polynomial modelings. To run the different polynomial modelings, (un)comment the related part in `attack.sage`.
